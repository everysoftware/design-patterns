"""
Event Sourcing is an architectural pattern in which each change in the state of a system is recorded as a
separate event. Instead of storing the current state of an object, the system stores the sequence of events that led to
that state. When necessary, the current state is restored by "replaying" the events in the order in which they occurred.
