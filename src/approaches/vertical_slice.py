"""
Vertical Slice is an architectural pattern that suggests that each feature should be implemented in its own slice
of the architecture. This means that each feature should have its own set of classes, including controllers, services,
and repositories. This pattern is useful for large applications that have many features, as it helps to keep the
codebase organized and maintainable.
